# Swym-Gatsby Store

 Swym-Gatsby Store is an implementation of the `Swym Wishlist` with Gatsby. Gatsby is React framework that we can use to build fast and dynamic Shopify custom storefronts.

 In this implementation we are using the Swym Wishlist APIs and integrate it with the custom storefront. We can use our Wishlist App for various functions including - 
 - Add Products to list
 - Create Multiple list
 - Delete product from list
 - Share Wishlist via Email & Copy Link
